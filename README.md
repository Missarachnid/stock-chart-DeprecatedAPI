#  Stock Market Charting App - No longer hosted, code only

This started out as a Free Code Camp project, but they redid all the requirements while I was working ont this.

### This project's API changed. I will return to it later to update it. For now only the code is available.

### Author:

###  Built With: 

*  HTML
*  CSS
*  JavaScript
*  React (Create React App)
*  Node.js
*  Express
*  IEX Trading API
*  Bootstrap 4
*  MongoDB / Mongoose
*  MLab
*  axios
* HighStock from HighCharts

### What Does It Do

*  Users can add upto 5 stocks and see the price fluctuations over the past year.
*  Stocks users add are added to an mlab database.
*  Users can delete stocks from the lineup.
*  Users can change the date range on the chart.
*  Users focus on a day in the chart and it will give them the closing prices for all stocks displayed.

### Future Functionality
* The original project called for websockets. Since the Free Code Camp projects were reset I decided to finish what I had and go on to other projects. 
I would like to add this eventually.
*  I would like to add Redux for state managment
*  I would like to make the chart full accessible for screen readers.
